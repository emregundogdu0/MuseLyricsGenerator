Come waste your millions here
Secretly she sneers
Another corporate show
A guilty conscience grows

And I'll feel
A guilty conscience grow
And I'll feel
A guilty conscience grow

She burns like the sun
And I can't look away
And she'll burn our horizons
Make no mistake

Come let the truth be shared
No-one ever dared
To break these endless lies
Secretly she cries

She burns like the sun
I can't look away
And she'll burn our horizons
Make no mistake

And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll run forever
I can't face the shame

And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll run forever
I can't face the shame 
She had something to confess to
But you don't have the time so
Look the other way
You will wait until it's over
To reveal what you'd never shown her
Too little much too late

Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world

Can you see that I am needing
Begging for so much more
Than you could ever give
I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you yeah
And I'll do it on my own

I have played in every toilet
But you still want to spoil it
To prove I've made a big mistake

Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world

Can you see that I am needing
Begging for so much more
Than you could ever give
I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you yeah

So I'll do it on my own
And I'll do it all by myself
You will never make it
It's happening soon
It's happening soon
It's scent has been blowing in my direction
To me it is new
To me it is new
And it's not gonna change for anybody

And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you

It's got to be here
It's got to be there
It's got to be now
Or I'll lose for ever

To me it is strange
This feeling is strange
But it's not gonna change for anybody

And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you

Accuse me
Trust me
I never knew
That you were the one
You were the one
Oh

And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you

And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you
I'm falling down
And fifteen thousand people scream
They were all begging for your dream

I'm falling down
Five thousand houses burning down yeah
No one is gonna save this town

Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't here
No it wasn't here

I was calling your name
But you would never hear me sing
You wouldn't let me begin

So I'm crawling away
'Cause you broke my heart in two yeah
No, I will not forget you

Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you
Noooooo

Falling away
You never see me fall
No, I could not forget you
Falling down
A thousand houses burning down
No one is gonna save this town

Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you
No

Falling down
Now the world is upside down
I'm heading straight for the clouds 
Leave me alone
It's nothing serious
I'll do it myself
It's got nought to do with you
And there's nothing that you could do

You can see it and you can almost hear it too
You can almost taste it
It's nought to do with you
And there's still nothing that you could do

So come in my cave
And I'll burn your heart away
Come in my cave
And I'll burn your heart away

Please close your ears
And try to look away
So you'll never hear a, a single word I say
And don't ever come my way

Leave me alone
It's nothing serious
I'll do it myself
It's got nought to do with you
And there's still nothing you could do

So come in my cave
And I'll burn your heart away
Come in my cave
And arrest me for my mistakes, yeah
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
And forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And pushing us into self destruction
And pushing us into self destruction

And they make me
Make me dream your dreams
And they make me
Make me scream your screams

Trying to please you for too long
Trying to please you for too long
Visions of greed you wallow
Rhythms of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow
Rhythms of greed you wallow

And they make me
Make me dream your dreams
And they make me
Make me scream your screams

Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
And forcing our darkest souls to unfold

They make me
Make me dream your dreams

Make me scream your screams

Unintended

You could be my unintended
Choice to live my life extended
You could be the one I'll always love
You could be the one who listens
To my deepest inquisitions
You could be the one I'll always love

I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before

First there was the one who challenged
All my dreams and all my balance
She could never be as good as you

You could be my unintended
Choice to live my life extended
You should be the one I'll always love

I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before

I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before
Before you 

Uno 

This means nothing to me
'Cause you are nothing to me
And it means nothing to me
That you blew this away

'Cause you could have been number one
If you only found the time
And you could have ruled the whole world
If you had the chance

You could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun
But you blew it away

You're still nothing to me
And this is nothing to me
And you don't know what you've done
But I'll give you a clue

You could have been number one
If you only had the chance
And you could have ruled the whole world
If you had the time

You could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun
But you blew it away

You could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun
But you blew it away 

Sober 

Royal Canadian blended
The spicy aroma had mended me
Matured for years and imported
Into my glass you poured it

And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me

You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
'Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me

Wild turkey's been chosen
Its caramel nose can smell me
Arbourler, Jameson I love you
The single malts come burning

And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me

You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
'Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me

Royal Canadian Blended
The spicy aroma had mended me
And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me

You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
'Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me 

Escape 

You would say anything
And you would try anything
To escape your meaningless
And your insignificance

You're uncontrollable
And we are unlovable
And I don't want you to think that I care
I never would
I never could
Again

Why can't you just love her
And why be such a monster
You bully from a distance
Your brain needs some assistance

But I'll still take all the blame
'Cause you and me are both one and the same
And it's driving me mad
And it's driving me mad

I'll take back all the things that I said
I didn't realise I was talking to the living dead
And I don't want you to think that I care
I never would
I never could
Again

You would say anything
And you would try anything
To escape your meaningless
And your insignificance 

Overdue 

You needed it when I was away
And no matter what I say
You'll never forget when I wasn't there so
Why should I care
I'm young but I know that I'm aroused

You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there

It doesn't matter where I have gone
I just can't afford to
Pay for all the mistakes that you have made
It's about time I was paid
I'm young but I know that I'm aroused

You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there

You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there

You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there

Hate This & I'll Love You 

Oh I am growing tired
Of allowing you to steal
Everything I have
You're making me feel
Like I was born to service you
But I am growing by the hour

You left us far behind
So we all discard our souls
And blaze through your skies
So afraid to die

'Cause I was born to destroy you
And I am growing by the hour
I'm getting strong in every way
Yeah, Yeah

You led me on
You led me on
You

Oh, and I'm getting strong in every way
Yeah, Yeah 
Link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like a birth squeeze
The love for what you hide
The bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born
When you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

Hopeless time to roam
The distance to your home
Fades away to nowhere
How much are you worth
You can't come down to earth
You're swelling up, you're unstoppable

'Cause you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away
Just break the silence
'Cause I'm drifting away
Away from you

Link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like it's a birth squeeze
And the love for what you hide
And the bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born

When you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting their last chance
To come away
Just break the silence
‘Cause I'm drifting away
Away from you 

Bliss

Everything about you is how I wanna be
Your freedom comes naturally
Everything about you resonates happiness
Now I won't settle for less

Give me all the peace and joy in your mind

Everything about you pains my envying
Your soul can't hate anything
Everything about you is so easy to love
They're watching you from above

Give me all the peace and joy in your mind
I want the peace and joy in your mind
Give me the peace and joy in your mind

Everything about you resonates happiness
Now I won't settle for less

Give me all the peace and joy in your mind
I want the peace and joy in your mind
Give me the peace and joy in your mind

Space dementia

H8 is the one for me
It gives me all I need
And helps me co-exist with the chill

You make me sick because I adore you so
I love all the dirty tricks
And twisted games you play on me

Space dementia in your eyes
Peace will arise and tear us apart
And make us meaningless again

You'll make us want to die
I'd cut your name in my heart
We'll destroy this world for you
I know you want me to feel your pain

Space dementia in your eyes
And Peace will arise and tear us apart
And make us meaningless again

Hyper music

Your golden lies feed my role
In this forgotten space race under my control
Who's returned from the dead
Who remains
Just to spit it in your face

You know that I don't want you
And I never did
I don't want you and I never will

You wanted more than I was worth
And you think I was scared
And you needed proof
Who really cares anymore
Who restrains
Just to spit it in your face

You know I don't love you and I never did
I don't want you and I never will

Plug In Baby

I've exposed your lies, baby
The underneath no big surprise
Now it's time for changing
And cleansing everything
To forget your love

My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving
Wooah

My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living
Ooh

Don't confuse
Baby you're gonna lose
Your own game
Change me
And replace the envying
To forget your love

My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving
Wooah

My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living
Ooh

And I've seen your loving
Mine is gone
And I've been in trouble
Ooh yeah

Citizen Erased

Break me in, teach us to cheat
And to lie, cover up
What shouldn't be shared
And the truth's unwinding
Scraping away at my mind
Please stop asking me to describe him

For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open minded
I'm sure I used to be so free

Self-expressed, exhausting for all
To see and to be
What you want and what you need
The truth's unwinding
Scraping away at my mind
Please stop asking me to describe

For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open minded
I'm sure I used to be so free

For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open minded
I'm sure I used to be so free

Wash me away
Clean your body of me
Erase all the memories
They will only bring us pain
And I've seen, all I'll ever need 

*** Thanx a lot to Francesco who corrected this one ***

Micro cuts

Hands are red with your blame
Megaphone screaming my name
Whimpers someone I should've loved
Souls weeping above

I've seen what you're doing to me
Destroying puppet strings
To our souls

Micro waves me insane
A blade cuts in your brain
Sounds like forks on a plate
Blackboard scratched with hate

I've seen what you're doing to me
Destroying puppet strings
To our souls 

*** Thanx a lot to Tom who corrected a mistake ***

Screenager

Who's so phoney and always surrounded
Stop your screaming, no-one can hear
All the scars on your skin, post no bills

Who you were
Was so beautiful
Remember who... who you where

Hide from the mirror, the cracks and the memories
Hide from your family, they won't know you now
For all the holes in our soul host no thrills

Who you were
Was so beautiful
Memories who... who you were 

*** Thanx a lot to Lain who corrected a mistake ***

Dark Shines

Passing by
You light up my darkest skies
You'll take only seconds to draw me in
So be mine
And your innocence
I will consume

Dark shines
Bringing me down
Making my heart feel sore
'Cause it's good

Hold your hands
Up to your eyes again
Hide from the scary scenes
Suppress your fears
So be mine
And your innocence
I will consume

Dark shines
Bringing me down
Making my heart feel sore
'Cause it's good

Your dark shines
Bringing me down
Making my heart feel sore
'Cause it's good

Dark shines
Bringing me down
Making my heart feel sore
'Cause it's good

Feeling Good

Birds flying high you know how I feel 
Sun in the sky you know how I feel 
Reeds driftin' on by you know how I feel

It's a new dawn 
It's a new day 
It's a new life 
For me 
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea you know how I feel 
River running free you know how I feel 
Blossom in the tree you know how I feel

It's a new dawn 
It's a new day 
It's a new life 
For me 
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean, don't you know 
Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean 
Sleep in peace when day is done 
And this old world is a new world 
And a bold world 
For me

Stars when you shine you know how I feel 
Scent of the pine you know how I feel 
Yeah freedom is mine 
And you know how I feel

It's a new dawn 
It's a new day 
It's a new life 
For me 
And I'm feeling good, oooh

Megalomania

Paradise comes at a price
That I am not prepared to pay
What were we built for
Could someone tell me please

The good news is, she can't have babies
And won't accept gifts from me
What are they for
They'll just grow up
And break the laws you've loved

Take off your disguise
I know that underneath
It's me
Who are you oooh

Useless device, it won't suffice
I want a new game to play
When I am gone
It won't be long, before I disturb you in the dark

Paradise comes at a price
That I am not prepared to pay
What were we built for
Will someone tell me please

Take off your disguise
I know that underneath
It's me

Shrinking Universe

( New Born single - June 01 )

Cast your ideals on to me
And I'll show you what you really need 
Give too much attention 
And I'll reflect your imperfections

Can't you see it's over 
Because you're the god of a shrinking universe

Purposeless survival 
Now there's nothing left to die for 
So don't struggle to recognize 
Now the cruelly heart-felt suicide

Can't you see it's over 
Because you're the god of a shrinking universe

Can't you see it's over 
Because you're the god of a shrinking universe 

Recess

( Unintended single - June 00 )

Resuscitate
In my sleep
Awake to see
You're never here

And the losing yields
Another year
Facing hopes and fears

And I wish
I could believe there was more
Hopes suffocating
You've kissed my life

And the planes and trains
Are to blame
For tempting us
To refrain
And to cut the chord
Dis every word
Of the truths absurd

And I wish
I could believe there was more
Hopes suffocating
You've kissed my life

Hopes suffocating
Hopes suffocating
Hopes suffocating
And you've kissed my life

Yes please

( Sunburn single - February 00 )

I cannot sleep
There's too much noise in my head
I cannot sleep
I want it here instead

I never thought that this could come to this
I just wanna look at your face in peace now
You will never miss
But I can

I cannot keep
The shame that's clawed us out
And I will not keep
Your shut up, shut up lies

I never thought that this could come to this
I just wanna live in bliss, in peace now
You will never miss
But I can

*** Thanx a lot to Alex for this one ***

Map Of Your Head

( New Born single - June 01 )

I'm sick of feeling my soul 
To people who'll never know 
Just how purposeless and empty they've grown 
Because the language confuses like computers
Refuse to understand how I'm feeling today

I'm freezing and losing my way 
I don't need another map of your head 
I'm freezing and losing my way 
I don't need another map of your head

I saw a liquid control 
That gives life to a soul 
I hit my head on it and woke up to know 
That I was all alone
Wearing just socks and a phone 
Someone is screaming like their world might explode

Yeah I'm freezing and losing my way 
I don't need another map of your head 
I'm freezing and losing my way 
I don't want another map of your head

Freezing and losing my way 
I don't want another map of your head 
I'm freezing and losing my way 
I don't need another map of your head

Nature 1

Conforming on a monday 
Too often and too cold 
But you aren't even listening 
'Cause you are just
Too old to feel an earthquake 
Or too cool to even care 
But you aren't even listening 
So why should I

You are a natural disaster 
And I've wanted you too much 
And now I'm gonna lose 
I've wanted you too much 
And now I've gotta choose
You're the cause of all this 
And I'm sick of trying to please you 
And you're gonna feel my emotions coming 
'Cause you're the world

Like a broken dam you're empty 
And all that's left are the sticks and stones 
That were built by other people 
And it really shows 
But you aren't even listening 
Because you are just
Too old to feel an earthquake 
Or too cool to even care 
But you aren't even listening 
So why should I

You are a natural disaster 
And I've wanted you too much 
And now I'm gonna lose 
I've wanted you too much

Shine (acoustic)

( Hypermusic single - November 01 )

Who cares for the life we've earned
Someone's sold all the truth you yearned
Remember when we used to shine
And had no fear or sense of time
When it creeps up on you

You can't cry now there's nothing to feel
No one's noticed our loneliness
Remember when you should have teased
And made us scream eternal joy

I believed that you'd always be here
'Cause once you promised a life with no fear
Please don't break my ideals
And say what fake was always real
I was the one, now I'm gone
Take me back again

Ashamed

( Sunburn single - February 00 )

I know there's something
That you're dying to tell me
I hope it's not about it incase you love me

Make sure no-one finds out
And tell me all about it
Don't keep it to yourself
Because I can't bear the thought
I never needed your cry
I know you love me
It doesn't matter 'cause I'll make you crawl

I know that you're ashamed
So emotional it kills you
Don't you know that you're ashamed
So emotional it kills you

There's always something that makes you guilty
There's still something that you're dying to tell me

Make sure no-one finds out
And tell me all about it
Don't keep it to yourself
Because I'll beg for more
I never needed your cry
I know you love me
It doesn't matter cause I need you so

I know that you're ashamed
So emotional it kills you
Don't you know that you're ashamed
So much that it thrills you

Too lonely to pretend
Like everything is new

Blow it all away

Too weak to sing along

In your world
No one is dying alone

You do it to me sweetly

Declare this an emergency
Come on and spread a sense of urgency
And pull us through

Come on it's time for something biblical
To pull us through
And pull us through
And this is the end
This is the end of the world

Proclaim eternal victory
Come on and change the course of history
And pull us through
And pull us through
And this is the end
This is the end of the world

Time is running out

I think I'm drowning
Asphyxiated
I wanna break this spell
That you've created

You're something beautiful
A contradiction
I wanna play the game
I want the friction

You will be the death of me
You will be the death of me

Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it

Our time is running out
Our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out

I wanted freedom
Bound and restricted
I tried to give you up
But I'm addicted

Now that you know I'm trapped
Sense of elation
You'd never dream of
Breaking this fixation

You will squeeze the life out of me

Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it

And our time is running out
And our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
How did it come to this

You will suck the life out of me

Tiptoe to your room
A starlight in the gloom
I only dream of you
And you never knew

Sing for absolution

And falling from your grace

There's nowhere left to hide
In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside
And will never die

I won't hold you back
Let your anger rise
And we'll fly and we'll fall and we'll burn
No one will recall, no one will recall

This is the last time I'll abandon you
And this is
The last time I'll forget you
I wish I could

Look to the stars
Let hope burn in your eyes
And we'll love and we'll hate
And we'll die
All to no avail, all to no avail

This is the last time I'll abandon you
And this is
The last time I'll forget you
I wish I could

Falling Away With You

I can't remember when it was good
Moments of happiness elude
Maybe I just misunderstood

All of the love we left behind
Watching the flash backs intertwine
Memories I will never find

So I'll love whatever you become
And forget the reckless things we've done
I think our lives have just begun
I think our lives have just begun

And I feel my world crumbling
I feel my life crumbling
I feel my soul crumbling away
And falling away
Falling away with you

Staying awake to chase a dream
Tasting the air you're breathing in
I know I won't forget a thing

Promise to hold you close and pray
Watching the fantasies decay
Nothing will ever stay the same

All of the love we threw away
All of the hopes we cherished fade
Making the same mistakes again
Making the same mistakes again

And I'll feel my world crumbling
I'll feel my life crumbling
I'll feel my soul crumbling away
And falling away
Falling away with you

All of the love we've left behind
Watching the flash backs intertwine
Memories I will never find
Memories I will never find

Hysteria

It's bugging me
Grating me
And twisting me around
Yeah I'm endlessly
Caving in
And turning inside out

'Cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

It's holding me, morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly cold within
And dreaming I'm alive

'Cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm not breaking down
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

And I want you now
I want you now
I'll feel my heart implode
I'm breaking out
Escaping now
Feeling my faith erode

*** Thanx a lot to Kristian & Ann-Julie & Dan & Helga Dís who corrected some mistakes ***

Blackout

Don't kid yourself
And don't fool yourself
This love's too good to last
And I'm too old to dream

Don't grow up too fast
And don't embrace the past
This life's too good to last
And I'm too young to care

Don't kid yourself
And don't fool yourself
This life could be the last
And we're too young to see

*** Thanx a lot to Ugo who updated this one ***

Butterflies And Hurricanes

Change everything you are
And everything you were
Your number has been called

Fights and battles have begun
Revenge will surely come
Your hard times are ahead

Best, you've got to be the best
You've got to change the world
And use this chance to be heard
Your time is now

Change everything you are
And everything you were
Your number has been called
Fights and battles have begun
Revenge will surely come
Your hard times are ahead

Best, you've got to be the best
You've got to change the world
And use this chance to be heard
Your time is now

Don't let yourself down
And don't let yourself go
Your last chance has arrived

Best, you've got to be the best
You've got to change the world
And use this chance to be heard
Your time is now

The small print

Take, take all you need
And I'll compensate your greed
With broken hearts

Sell, I'll sell your memories
For fifteen pounds per year
But just the good days

Say, it'll make you insane
And its bending the truth
You're to blame
For all the life that you'll lose
And you watch this space
But I'm going all the way
And be my slave to the grave
I'm the priest god never paid

Hope, I hope you've seen the light
'Cause no one really cares
They're just pretending

Sell, I sell your memories
For fifteen pounds per year
But you can keep the bad days

Say, it'll make you insane
And I'm bending the truth
You're to blame
For all the life that you'll lose
And you watch this space
And I'm going all the way
And be my slave to the grave
I'm the priest god never paid

Say, it'll make you insane
And I'm bending the truth
You're to blame
For all the life that you'll lose
And you watch this space
And I'm going all the way
And be my slave to the grave
I'm the priest god never paid

Endlessly

There's a part of me
You'll never know
The only thing
I'll never show

Hopelessly
I'll love you endlessly
Hopelessly
I'll give you everything
But I won't give you up
I won't let you down
I won't leave you falling
If the moment ever comes

It's plain to see
It's trying to speak
Cherished dreams
Forever asleep

Hopelessly
I'll love you endlessly
Hopelessly
I'll give you everything
But I won't give you up
I won't let you down
I won't leave you falling
But the moment never comes

Hopelessly
I'll love you endlessly
Hopelessly
I'll give you everything
But I won't give you up
I won't let you down
I won't leave you falling
But the moment never comes

Thoughts Of A Dying Atheist

Eerie whispers
Trapped beneath my pillow
Won't let me see
Your memories

I know you're in this room
I'm sure I heard you sigh
Floating in-between
Where our worlds collide

It scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see

I know the moment's near
And there's nothing we can do
Look through a faithless eye
Are you afraid to die

It scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see

It scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see

*** Thanx a lot to Vicky & Helga Dís who corrected this one ***

Ruled By Secrecy

Repress and restrain
Steal the pressure and the pain
Wash the blood off your hands
This time she won't understand

Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control

You're working so hard
And you're never in charge
Your death creates success
Rebuild and suppress

Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control

Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control

*** Thanx a lot to Francesco who corrected this one ***

Fury

You're so happy now
Burning a candle at both ends
Your self-loving soothes
And softens the blows you've invented

Breathe in deep, and cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray that there's no God
To punish us and make a fuss

Crack's healing up
Future soul forgive this mess
You waste twenty years
And wind up alone, demented

Breathe in deep, and cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray that there's no God
To punish us and make a fuss

Breathe in deep, and cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray that there's no God
To punish us and make a fuss

Starlight

Far away
The ship has taken me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

Starlight
I will be chasing a starlight
Until the end of my life
I don't know if it's worth it anymore

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms

My life
You electrify my life
Let's conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive

But I'll never let you go
If you promise not to fade away
Never fade away

Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms

Far away
The ship has taken me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

And i'll never let you go
If you promise not to fade away
Never fade away

Oh baby, don't you know I suffer
And oh baby, can't you hear me moan
You caught me under false pretences
How long before you let me go

Oh, you set my soul alight
Oh, you set my soul alight

Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive

Glaciers melting in the dead of night

Map of the Problematique

Fear, and panic in the air
I want to be free
From desolation and despair
And I feel like everything I sow
Is being swept away
Well I refuse to let you go

I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you

Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over

Life will flash before my eyes
So scattered and lost
I want to touch the other side
And no one thinks they are to blame
Why can't we see
That when we bleed we bleed the same

I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you

Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over
Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over

Soldier's poem

Throw it all away
Let's lose ourselves
'Cause there's no one left for us to blame
It's a shame we're all dying
And do you think you deserve your freedom

How could you send us so far away from home
When you know damn well that this is wrong
I will still lay down my life for you
And do you think you deserve your freedom

No I don't think you do
There's no justice in the world
There's no justice in the world
And there never was

Invincible

Follow through
Make your dreams come true
Don't give up the fight
You will be all right
'Cause there's no one like you in the universe

Don't be afraid
Of what your mind conceives
You should make a stand
Stand up for what you believe
And tonight
We can truly say
Together we're invincible

During the struggle
They will pull us down
But please, please
Let's use this chance
To turn things around
And tonight
We can truly say
Together we're invincible

Do it on your own
It makes no difference to me
What you leave behind
And what you choose to be
And whatever they say
Your soul's unbreakable

During the struggle
They will pull us down
But please, please
Let's use this chance
To turn things around
And tonight
We can truly say
Together we're invincible

Together we're invincible

During the struggle
They will pull us down
Please, please
Let's use this chance
To turn things around
And tonight
We can truly say
Together we're invincible

Together we're invincible

Assassin

War is overdue
The time has come for you
To shoot your leaders down
Join forces underground

Lose control
Increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
And time to erase

Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born

Aim, shoot, kill your leaders

Oppose and disagree
Destroy demonocracy

Lose control
Increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
And time to erase

Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born

Exo-Politics

Open skies over me
I am waiting patiently
I'll wait for a sign

As conspiracies unwind
Will you slam shut
Or free your mind
Or stay hypnotised

When the Zetas fill the skies
Will our leaders tell us why
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds

And I'm waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign

Carried through the centuries
Secrets locked up
And loaded on my back
Well it weights me down

When the Zetas fill the skies
It's just our leaders in disguise
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds

I'm waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign, yeah
And I'm waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign

City of Delusion

Stay away from me
Build a fortress
And shield your beliefs
Touch the divine
As we fall in line

Can I believe
When I don't trust
All your theories
Turn to dust
I choose to hide
From the All Seeing Eye

Destroy this City of Delusion
Break these walls down
I will avenge
And justify my reasons
With your blood

You'll not rest
Or settle for less
Until you guzzle
And squander what's left
Do not deny
That you live and let die

Destroy this City of Delusion
And break these walls down
I will avenge
And justify my reasons
With your blood

Destroy this City of Delusion
And break these walls down
I will avenge
And justify my reasons
With your blood

Hoodoo

Come into my life
Regress into a dream
We will hide
And build a new reality
Draw another picture
Of the life you could have had
Follow your instincts
And choose the other path

You should never be afraid
You're protected from trouble and pain
Why, why is this a crisis in your eyes again

Come to be
How did it come to be
Tied to a railroad
No love to set us free
Watch our souls fade away
And our bodies crumbling
Don't be afraid
I will take the blow for you

And I've had recurring nightmares
That I was loved for who I am
And missed the opportunity
To be a better man

Knights of Cydonia

Come ride with me
Through the veins of history
I'll show you a god
Who falls asleep on the job

And how can we win
When fools can be kings
Don't waste your time
Or time will waste you

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
Uprising

Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to, push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that, we will never see the truth around
(so come on)
Another promise, another seed
Another, packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the, Green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless, red tape to keep the truth confined
(so come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
So come on

Interchanging mind control
Come let the, revolution takes its toll
If you could, flick the switch and open your third eye
You'd see that
We should never be afraid to die
(so come on)

Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
They know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not enslave us
We will be victorious

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They can not control us
We will be victorious

Resistance

Is our secret safe tonight
And are we out of sight
Or will our world come tumbling down
Will they find our hiding place
Is this our last embrace
Or will the walls start caving in

It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole

It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong could be....

Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they wont to stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

If we live a life in fear
I'll wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile again

Kill your prayers for love and peace
You'll wake the thought police
We can't hide the truth inside

It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole

It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong could be....

Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they wont to stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

The night has reached its end
We can't pretend
We must run
We must run
Its time to run
Take us away from here
Protect us from further harm
Resistance

Undisclosed Desires

I know you've suffered
But I don't want you to hide
It's cold and loveless
I won't let you be denied

Soothing
I'll make you feel pure
Trust me
You can be sure

I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart

You trick your lovers
That you're wicked and divine
You may be a sinner
But your innocence is mine

Please me
Show me how it's done
Tease me
You are the one

I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart

Please me
Show me how it's done
Trust me
You are the one

I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart

United States Of Eurasia (+Collateral Damage)

United States of Eurasia
You and me are the same
We don't know or care who's to blame
But we know that whoever holds the reigns
Nothing will change
Our cause has gone insane
And these wars they can't be won
And these wars they can't be won
Do you want them to go on and on and on
Why split these states
When there can be only one
And must we do as we're told
Must still do as we're told
You and me fall in line
To be punished for unproven crimes
And we know that there's no one we can trust
Our ancient heroes
They are turning to dust
And these wars they can't be won
Does anyone know or care how they begun
They just promise to go on and on and on
But soon we will see
There can be only one
United States
United States of Eurasia

Guiding Light

Pure hearts stumble
In my hands, they crumble
Fragile and stripped to the core
I can't hurt you anymore
Loved by numbers
You're losing life's wonder
Touch like strangers; detached
I can't feel you anymore
The sunshine trapped in our hearts
It could rise again
But I'm lost, crushed, cold and confused with no guiding light left inside

You were my guiding light

When comfort and warmth can't be found I still reach for you
But I'm lost, crushed, cold and confused with no guiding light left inside

You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light
When there's no guiding light left inside
When there's no guiding light in our lives

Unnatural Selection

They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No chance for fate
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth

I am hungry for some unrest
I want to push this beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that they'll understand

Dedication, to a new age
Is this the end of destruction and rampage?
Another chance to erase then repeat it again

Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean

They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No chance for fate
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth

No religion or mind virus
Is there a hope that the facts will ever find us
Just make sure that you are looking out for number one

I am hungry for an unrest
Let's push this beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that you will understand

Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean

They'll laugh as they watch us crawl
The lucky don't share at all
No hope for fate, it's a random chance selection
I want the truth

Try to ride out the storm
Whilst they'll make you believe
That they are the special ones
(We have not been chosen)

Injustice is the norm
You won't be the first and you know you won't be the last

Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean

They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No chance for fate
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth, I want the truth
I want the truth, I want the truth

MK Ultra

The wavelength gently grows
Coercive notions re-evolve
A universe is trapped inside a tear
It resonates the core
Creates unnatural laws
Replaces love and happiness with fear

How much deception can you take
How many lies will you create
How much longer until you break
Your mind's about to fall

And they are breaking through
They are breaking through
They are breaking through
We are losing control

They are breaking through
They are breaking through
They are breaking through
Now we are falling
We are losing control

Invisible to all
The mind becomes a wall
All of history deleted with one stroke

How much deception can you take
How many lies will you create
How much longer until you break
Your mind's about to fall

And they are breaking through
They are breaking through
They are breaking through
Now we are falling
We are losing control

I Belong To You (+Mon coeur s'ouvre à ta voix)

When these pillars get pulled down
It will be you who wears the crown
And I'll owe everything to you

How much pain has cracked your soul
How much love would make you whole
You're my guiding lightning strike

I can't find the words to say
They're overdue
I've travelled half the world to say
I belong to you

Then she attacks me like a Leo
When my heart is split like Rio
But, I assure you my debts are real

I can't find the words to say
When I'm confused
I travelled half the world to say
You are my mu-se

Ah! Répond, répond à ma tendresse
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse
Répond à ma tendresse
Répond à ma tendresse
Ah verse-moi l'ivresse
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse
Répond à ma tendresse
Répond à ma tendresse
Ah verse-moi l'ivresse

I belong
I belong to you alone

I can't find the words to say
They're overdue
Travelled half the world to say
I belong to you

Exogenesis: Symphony Part 1 (Overture)

Aping my soul
You stole my overture
Trapped in God's program
Oh I can't escape

Who are we
Where are we
When are we
Why are we

Why can't we start it over again
Just let us start it over again
And we'll be good
This time we'll get it, get it right
It's our last chance to forgive ourselves
Supremacy

Wake to see
Your true emancipation is a fantasy
Policies have risen up and overcome the brave

Greatness dies
Unsung and lost invisible to history
Embedded spies
Brainwashing our children to be mean

You don't have long
I am on to you
The time, it has come to destroy
Your supremacy
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
You don't have long
I am on to you
The time, it has come to destroy
Your supremacy

Madness

I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness
Is starting to evolve

And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness
Is swallowing me whole, yeah

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you mean

Now, I need to know is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat
When I look back, at all the crazy fights we had
It's like some kind of madness
Was taking control, yeah
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Now, I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you need

Now, I have finally seen the end
And I'm not expecting you to care, no
That I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
I need your love
I need your love

Come to me
Just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes I know
I can't be wrong
And baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is madness

Panic Station

You won't get much closer
Until you sacrifice it all
You won't get to taste it
With your face against the wall

Get up and commit
Show the power trapped within
Do just what you want to
Now stand up and begin

Oh one, two, three, four, fire's in your eyes
And this chaos it defies imagination
Five, six, seven, eight minus nine lives
You've arrived at panic station
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Doubts will try to break you
Unleash your heart and soul
Trouble will surround you
Start taking some control

Stand up and deliver
Your wildest fantasy
Do what the fuck you want to
There's no one to appease

Oh one, two, three, four, fire's in your eyes
And this chaos it defies imagination
Five, six, seven, eight minus nine lives
You've arrived at panic station

Oh one, two, three, four, fire's in your eyes
And this chaos it defies imagination.
Five, six, seven, eight minus nine lives

Oh one, two, three, four, fire's in your eyes
And you know I'm not resisting your temptations

You've arrived at panic station

Explorers

Once I hoped
To seek the new and unknown
This planet's overrun
There's nothing left for you or for me
Don't give in
We can walk through the fields
And feeling nature's glow
But all the land is owned
There's none left for you or for me
Who will win
‘Cause I concede

Free me
Free me
Free me from this world
I don't belong here
It was a mistake imprisoning my soul
Can you free me
Free me from this world

A world lush and blue
With rivers running wild
They'll be re-routed south
With none left for you or for me
Don't give in
Hear the engines roar
And save our crops from drought
But when the black gold's in doubt
There's none left for you or me
Fuse helium-3, our last hope
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Free me
Free me
Free me from this world
We don't belong here
It was a mistake imprisoning our souls
Can you free me
And free me from this world

Free me
I'll free you
Free us from this world
We don't belong here
It was a mistake imprisoning our souls
Can you free me
And free me from this world

Running around in circles
Feeling caged by endless rules
Can you free me
Free me from this world
Shh, go to sleep

Big Freeze

Healed
Or are you still just reeling
Are you fine
Have you found a way to escape
Are you here
Just because I need you
Can we hole up
A big freeze is heading our way

We are on a hiding to nowhere
We still hope, but our dreams are not the same
And I, I lost before I started
I'm collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't let the sun in your heart decay
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Fight
Or will you show me mercy
We've expelled
The goodness from our hearts
Are you here
Just to prove you're winning
Can we hole up
And ride out this electrical storm

We destroyed something beautiful
We have faith, but our truths are not the same
Don't give up, don't let the magic leave us
Stop the loneliest force becoming king of the universe

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't let the sun in your heart decay

Don't give up, don't let the magic leave us
We're collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't let the sun in our hearts decay

Save Me

Save me from my superstitions
Now I'm free, from this old condition
Wait just a while, and I'll greet you with a smile

Hold me 'cause I'm sure I'm hated
Promises, they are overrated
Wait just a while, while I'm drowning in denial

Turn me into someone like you
Find a place that we can go to
Run away and take me with you
Don't let go I need your rescue
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Watch me 'cause I'm on a mission
Hold me back, so I'm forced to listen
Don't let me go, 'cause I'm nothing without you

Turn me into someone like you
Find a place that we can go to
Run away and take me with you
Don't let go I need your rescue

Turn me into someone like you
Find a place that we can go to
Run away and take me with you
Don't let go I need your rescue

Liquid State

Take me for a ride
Break me up and steal what's left inside
And hope and pray iniquity has died inside and left a scar

I'm on red alert
Bring me peace and wash away my dirt
Spin me round and help me to divert
And walk into the light

Warm my heart tonight
Hold my head up high
Help me to survive

Kick me when I'm down
Feed me poison, fill me till I drown
Wake me up before I get pushed out
And fall into the night
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Warm my heart tonight
(Force me to lose control)
Hold my head up high
(Watch as I lose my soul)
Help me to survive
(Push me until I fall)

The 2nd Law: Unsustainable

All natural and technological processes
Proceed in such a way that the availability
Of the remaining energy decreases
In all energy exchanges, if no energy
Enters or leaves an isolated system
The entropy of that system increases
Energy continuously flows from being
Concentrated to becoming dispersed
Spread out, wasted and useless
New energy cannot be created and high grade
Energy is being destroyed
An economy based on endless growth is
Unsustainable

Unsu... Unsustain unsustain unser

Place fixed limits on technological innovation
And human advancement
In an isolated system; the entropy
Can only increase
A species set on endless growth is
Unsustainable

Dead Inside

Dead inside

Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share
Unleash a million drones
And confine me then erase me, babe
Do you have no soul?
It's like it died, long ago

Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside

You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverised
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go
You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinity
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft

Your skin feels warm to caress
I see magic in your eyes
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside

Feel me now, hold me please
I need you to see who I am
Open up to me, stop hiding from me
It's hurting, babe
Only you can stop the pain
Don't leave me out in the cold
Don't leave me out to die
I gave you everything, I can't give you any more
Now I've become just like you

My lips feel warm to the touch
My words seem so alive
My skin is warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotize
You've taught me to lie without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
Now I'm dead inside

[Drill Sergeant]

If you do not do what you're told to do when you're told to do it, you will be punished. Do you understand?

Psycho

Love, it will get you nowhere
You're on your own
Lost in the wild

Mercy

Help me, I've fallen on the inside
I tried to change the game, I tried to infiltrate but now I'm losing
Men in cloaks always seem to run the show
Save me from the ghosts and shadows before they eat my soul

Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?

Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under, hypnotized by another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks always have to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows the world just disavows

Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?
Show me mercy
Show me mercy, please

Help me, I've fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks trying to devour my soul

Show me mercy from the powers that be
Show me mercy from the gutless and mean
Show me mercy from the killing machines
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?

The Handler

You were my oppressor
And I, I have been programmed to obey
But now you are my handler
And I, I will execute your demands

Leave me alone
I must disassociate from you

Behold my trance formation
And you are empowered to do as you please
My mind was lost in translation
And my heart has become a cold and impassive machine

Leave me alone
I must disassociate from you

I won't let you control my feelings anymore
And I will no longer do as I am told
And I am no longer afraid to walk alone
Let me go
Let me be
I am escaping
From your grip
You will never own me again
Yeah

[JFK]

For we are opposed around the world
By a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
That relies primarily on covert means
For expanding its sphere of influence
On infiltration instead of invasion
On subversion instead of elections
On intimidation instead of free choice
On guerrillas by night instead of armies by day
It is a system which has conscripted
Vast human and material resources
Into the building of a tightly knit
Highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic
Intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations
Its preparations are concealed, not published
Its mistakes are buried, not headlined
Its dissenters are silenced, not praised

Defector

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inc-inc-inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

You think you're strong and you can't be broken
But your empire is dissolving
You thought, you thought I was weak
But you got it wrong
Look into my eyes
I'm a defector

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inc-inc-inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

Your blood is blue and your mind's turned green
And your belly is all yellow
You believe your throne is too high to be overthrown
We'll watch it get razed
By a defector

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inc-inc-inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

I'm a defector

Yeah, I'm free

Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

We look for strength and assistance
Confident that with your help
Man will be what he was born to be:
Free and independent

Revolt

How did we get in so much trouble
Getting out just seems impossible
Oppression is persisting
I can't fight this brain conditioning
Our freedom's just a loan
Run by machines and drones
They've got us locked into their sights
Soon, they'll control what's left inside
Don't try to hide it
Don't tell me it's not there

You've got strength, you've got soul
You've felt pain, you've felt love
You can grow (you can grow), you can grow (you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can revolt
You can revolt
You can revolt

Can you hear a distant thunder
Taste earth's blood and hunger
We live in a toxic jungle
Truth is suppressed to mumbles
They'll take away our homes
They're just machines and drones
Don't try to fight it
Don't tell me you can't see

You've got strength, you've got soul
You've felt pain, you've felt love
You can grow (you can grow), you can grow (you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can revolt
You can revolt
You can revolt

I can feel your pain
I can feel your confusion
I can see you're trapped in a maze
Let's find a way to escape

You've got strength, you've got soul
You're not afraid, you're not a drone
You can grow (you can grow), you can grow (you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can revolt
You can revolt
You can revolt

Aftermath

War is all around
I'm growing tired of fighting
I've been drained and I can't hide it
But I have strength for you, you're all that's real anymore
I am coming home now, I need your comfort

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

States are crumbling, and walls are rising high again
It's no place for the faint-hearted
But my heart is strong because now I know where I belong
It's you and I against the world
And we are free

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

We've gone against the tide
All we have is each other now
I am coming home now
I need your comfort

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

The Globalist

You were never truly loved
You have only been betrayed
You were never truly nurtured
By churches of the state
You were left unprotected
To these wild and fragile lands
But you can rise up like a god
Arm yourself
You can be strong
You can build a nuclear power
Transform the earth to your desire
Free your mind from false beliefs
You can be the commander in chief
You can hide your true motives
To dismantle and destroy

Now you finally have the code
I have given you the code
Oh oh oh ....
(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1...Fire!)

There's no country left
To love and cherish
It's gone, it's gone for good
It's you and me babe
Survivors
To hunt and gather memories
Of the great nation we were

There's no countries left
To fight and conquer
I think I destroyed them all
It's human nature
The greatest hunter
Will survive alone
With no one left to love
Ah ah ah ah...
There's no culture left
To love and cherish
It's gone, you know it's gone for good
A trillion memories
Lost in space and time forevermore
I just wanted
I just needed to be loved

Drones

Killed by drones
My mother, my father
My sister and my brother
My son and my daughter

Killed by drones
Our lives between your fingers and thumb
Can you feel anything at all
Are you dead inside
Now you can kill from the safety of your home with drones

Amen
Algorithm

Burn like a slave
Churn like a cog
We are caged in simulations
Algorithms evolve
Push us aside and render us obsolete

This means war

This means war
With your creator

Reload, crash out

This means war
With your creator
This means war
With your creator

The Dark Side

I have lived in darkness
For all my life, I've been pursued
You'd be afraid if you could feel my pain
And if you could see the things I am able to see

Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free

I hail from the dark side
For all my life, I've been besieged
You'd be scared living with my despair
And if you could feel the things I am able to feel

Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free

Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free
Save me from the dark side
Break me out, break me out
Set me free

Pressure

I'm trapped and my back's up against the wall
I see no solution or exit out
I'm grinding it out, no one can see
The pressure's growing exponentially
I'm trying to keep up to speed with you
Your lane changing is oscillating me
I'm hitting the ground and I'm sprinting
I'm falling behind now I'm tuning out

Something Human

My circuits have blown
I know it's self-imposed
And all I have shared, and all I have loved
Is all I'll ever own
But something has changed
I feel so alive
My life just blew up, I'd give it all up
I'll depressurize

Ten thousand miles left on the road
Five-hundred hours 'til I am home
I need something human, human
Human, human

Let's face all our fears
Come out of the shade
Let's burn all the money, absolve all the lies
And wake up unscathed
The big picture's gone
Replaced with visions of you
Now life can begin, I've cleansed all my sins
I'm about to break through

Five thousand miles left on the road
Two-hundred hours 'til I am home
I need something human, human
Human, human

And I need the touch
And something human, human

Less than a mile left on the road
I will be crawling through your door
I need something human, human
Human, human

And I need your love
And something human, human

Thought Contagion

Strung out falling from the big time
Welcome to the infinite black skies
Brain cleansed fractured identity
Fragments and scattered debris

Thought contagion
Thought contagion

Fall down learn when to count it out
Prop me up before I black out
Withdraw before you're out of time
A clean slate and buried war crimes

You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone who's hungrier than you
You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone's false beliefs
Thought contagion
Thought contagion

They'll never do what you want them to
Give it up and watch them break through
It's too late for a revolution
Brace for the final solution

Get Up And Fight

What we have's the only thing worth fighting for
And I, I won't let nothing keep us apart
Through these fallouts there is
A truth and pain but through it all
You will always have my heart

I see a change on the horizon
Reasons to be frightened
I know that we can pull through
I am here to tell you

Get up and fight
Get up and fight
I can't do this thing without you
I'm lost in this without you
Get up and fight
We've gotta get up and fight
I can't handle this without you
Can't do it without you

In our heads, a million voices scream and shout
And no one will ever hear a sound
Oh, only you can hush it
And calm the turmoil and the noise
And help me reach the higher ground

I see a change on the horizon
Reasons to be frightened
There's nothing we can't get through
I am here to tell you

To get up and fight
Get up and fight
I can't do this thing without you
I'm lost in this without you
Get up and fight
We've gotta get up and fight
I can't handle this without you
Can't do it without you

Get up and fight
Get up and fight
I can't do it without you

Get up and fight
Get up and fight
I can't do this thing without you
I'm lost in this without you
Get up and fight
We've gotta get up and fight
I can't handle this without you
Can't do it without you

I can't survive without your love in my life
You've gotta get up and fight

Blockades

The truth is that when I am killing in order to survive
I have never felt so alive
I am always seeking to live and die on the edge
Life is a broken simulation, I'm unable to feel
I'm searching for something that's real
I am always seeking to see what's behind the veil

Trapped in a maze of unseen walls
These blockades must fall

Crush, crush
Raze and rush
Seize, fight for your life
Smash, test
Beat the best
Fight for your life
You've been summoned now

I never sleep or rest
But I'm still running out of time
I have sacrificed all of my life
The time has come to
To prove to you what I'm worth

Trapped in a maze of endless walls
These blockades must fall

Crush, crush
Raze and rush
Seize, fight for your life
Smash, test
Beat the best
Fight for your life
You've been summoned now

Crush, crush
Raze and rush
Seize, fight for your life
Smash, test
Beat the best
Fight for your life
You've been summoned now

Dig Down

When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground
You must find a way
When the darkness descends and you're told it's the end
You must find a way

When God decides to look the other way and a clown takes the throne
We must find a way
Face the firing squad, against all the odds
You will find a way

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down and find faith
When you're close to the edge
With a gun to your head
You must find a way

When friends are thin on the ground and they try to divide us
We must find a way
We have entered the fray and we will not obey
We must find a way, yeah

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down and find faith
When they've left you for dead and you can only see red
You must find a way

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down, find faith
We won't let them divide, we will never abide
We will find a way

Dig down (Woah-oh-oh)
Dig down (Woah-oh-oh)

The Void

They'll say, no one can see us
That we're estranged and all alone
They believe nothing can reach us
And pull us out of the boundless gloom

They're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
Yeah, baby, they're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong

They'll say the sun is dying
And the fragile can't be saved
And the cold, it will devour us
And we won't rise up and slay giants

They're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
Yeah, baby, they're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong

It takes a leap of faith
To awake from these delusions
You are the coder and avatar
A star

They'll say, no one will find us
That we're estranged and all alone
They believe nothing can reach us
And pull us out of the boundless gloom

They're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
Baby, they're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong

Liberation

Silenced, you'll make us feel silenced

And, violence, you'll make us turn to violence
You've left us choice-less, our backs against the wall
No more

Won't Stand Down

I never believed that I would concede and let someone trample on me
You strung me along, I thought I was strong, but you were just gaslighting me
I've opened my eyes, and counted the lies, and now it is clearer to me
You are just a user, and an abuser, living vicariously

I never believed that I would concede and get myself blown asunder
You strung me along, I thought I was strong, but now you have pushed me under
I've opened my eyes, and counted the lies, and now it is clearer to me
You are just a user, and an abuser, and I refuse to take it

Won't stand down
I'm growing stronger
Won't stand down
I'm owned no longer
Won't stand down
You've used me for too long, now die alone

Now I'm coming back, a counterattack, I'm playing you at your own game
I'm cutting you out, a shadow of doubt
Is gonna hang over your name
I've opened my eyes, I see your disguise
I will never see you the same
I know how to win, before you begin
I'll shoot you before you take aim

Now I'm coming back, a counterattack
A psychological war
I'm cutting you in, I'm under your skin
Now I'm gonna settle the score
I've opened my eyes, I see your disguise
I will never see you the same
I know how to win, before you begin
I'll shoot you before you take aim

Won't stand down
I'm growing stronger
Won't stand down
I'm owned no longer
Won't stand down
You've used me for too long, now die alone

Won't stand down
I'm growing stronger
Won't stand down
I'm owned no longer
Won't stand down
You've used me for too long, now die alone

Ghosts (How Can I Move On)

Now and then
My mind drifts to a place where I find you
Lost in my head
There are unsolved feelings that haunt me
It's too late to heal
I'll lay them to rest

How can I move on
When everyone I see still talks about you?
How can I move on
When all the best things I have we made together?
Here's to letting go
But I am lost in a void with your ghost and our memories
Lest we forget
The great reset

If I could bring you back
There are truths and confessions I'd tell you
I'd set things straight
And I believe that you would love and forgive me
I know it's too late
I need to let go

And how can I move on
When everyone I see still talks about you?
How can I move on
When all the best things I have we built together?
Here's to letting go
But I am trapped in a void with your ghost and our memories
Lest we forget
The great reset

How can I sleep with this coldness beside me?
How can I sleep with this coldness inside me?
I know I can't bring back your love

How can I move on
When everyone I see still talks about you?
How can I move on
When all the best things I have we made together?
Here's to letting go
But I am lost in a void with your ghost and our memories
Lest we forget
The great reset

You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween

You got me checking my mirror
You make me feel like I'm on the run
Where'd you hide the gun

The kitchen knife in your hand
Are you the poison, are you the cure
I'm not so sure

I'm shackled, there is no way out
I can't escape

When you turn out the lights
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
When you skulk 'round the house
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)

You cut me off from my friends
You cut me off from my family
I'm in misery (I'm your number one fan)

Each day I fall to my knees
I see the writing is on the wall
Now I'm in withdrawal

I'm shackled, there is no way out
(There is nothing I can do to escape)
I can't escape

When you turn out the lights
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
The way you skulk 'round the house
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)

When you turn out the lights
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
When you skulk 'round the house
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
I see your eye in the key hole
I feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
Won't rest until I'm possessed
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)

(But you are the caretaker)

Kill Or Be Killed

(Kill or be killed)

Cornered, I'm exhausted with fear
Our love and compassion dissolved
And demons have materialised in me
Can't fight them, they're taking control

And we've tried, oh, we've tried so hard to be good
But the world rewards us when we're bad

Fate is driving me insane
It's forcing me to face
I must kill or be killed

(Kill or be killed)

They've driven a stake right through my heart
I'm growing so cold and detached

And I've tried, oh, I've tried so hard to spread love
But she prefers it when I assert control

Fate has brought us here to face
Our hopes and dreams erased
Either kill or be killed

(Kill or be killed)
(Kill or be killed)
Either kill or be killed

Fate, is driving me insane
It's forcing me to face
I must kill or be killed

(Kill or be killed)
(Kill or be killed)
(Kill or be killed)
(Kill or be)

Verona

Can we kiss with poison on our lips
Well I'm not scared
Can we touch and taste forbidden bliss
They can't stop us now, I won't let you be alone
I am coming for you

Keep us apart, it's too much to ask
We're running away
Take off your clothes and take off your mask
It's not over now, I won't leave you in the dark
Because I need you so

Can we kiss? Contagion on our lips
Well I don't care
We can touch and feel forbidden bliss
They can't stop us now, I won't let you feel alone
Because I need you so

You and me
Throw caution to the wind
And I will risk everything just to feel the warmth and the voltage of your skin
If this is my last day on Earth, I just want to be with you
You are all that's true

We will kiss with poison on our lips
Well I'm not scared
We will touch and reach forbidden bliss
They can't stop us now, I won't let you die alone
Because I love you so

Euphoria

Shut down
We are growing spiritless
If no one cares, then who is gonna save us?
Give us euphoria

Worn out
Everything will fall apart
So shine a light and warm up this heavy heart
And give us euphoria

Brooding
I need renewing
I want satisfaction
A gut reaction

Give us euphoria
Give us euphoria
It's been all work and no play
Give us euphoria
Give us euphoria
I need to numb all the pain

Wake up
We're becoming restless
Our last hope and only you can save us
And give us euphoria

Sealed off
We are running out of air
So start a fire and spice up this love affair
Give us euphoria

Brooding
I need renewing
I need satisfaction
A gut reaction

Give us euphoria
Give us euphoria
It's been all work and no play
Give us euphoria
Give us euphoria
I need to numb all the pain

Euphoria
Give us euphoria
It's been all work and no play
Give me euphoria
I need euphoria
I need to numb all the pain

We Are Fucking Fucked

You really believe
We can survive all of this
The black vacuum of the universe
It was designed
To swallow us whole
It's a losing game

We're at death's door
Another world war
Wildfires and earthquakes I foresaw
A life in crisis
A deadly virus
Tsunamis of hate are gonna find us

We are fucking fucked
We are fucking fucked

We're at deaths' door
Another world war
Wildfires and earthquakes I foresaw
A life in crisis
Mutated virus
Tsunamis of hate are gonna drown us

We are fucking fucked
We are fucking fucked

True
Just when you think
You are safe and secure
You'll forget what you need to remember
Living in peace
But you're living a lie
The game is rigged

We're at deaths' door
Another world war
Wildfires and earthquakes I foresaw
A life in crisis
Mutated virus
Tsunamis of hate are gonna drown us

We are fucking fucked
We are fucking fucked

Hole up
Stockpile
Hoard up
We are getting fucking fucked

We are getting fucked
We are getting fucked

Hey, hey, hey, fuck off
Hey, hey, hey, stockpile
Hey, hey, hey, fuck off
Hey, hey, we are getting fucking fucked
Can't Take My Eyes Off You

(In your world EP / Frankie Valli cover)

You're just too good to be true
Can't keep my eyes off you
You feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you makes me weak
There are no words left to speak
And if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just to good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I love you baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I've found this day
Let me love you baby, let me love you

You're just too good to be true
Can't keep my eyes off you
You feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I love you baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I've found this day
Let me love you baby, let me love you

*** Thanx a lot to Mike for this one ***

Coma 

(Cave EP)

Confide in me
Sustain on my apathy
You're such a mess
You can learn not to confess

You will not find it in me
Simply because I can't
Wake up and find it in me
I`m in a coma

You will not find it in me
You'll reveal all your pains again
We'll fall asleep
So deeply out of reach
For years feeling dead
We can fall right out of bed

You will not find it in me
Simply because I can't
Wake and find it in me
I'm in a coma

You will not find it in me
You'll reveal all your pains again

Hey such a mess but I don't care
Simply because I can't
Wake and find it in me
I'm in a coma

You will not find it in me
You'll reveal all your pains again 

Con-Science

Crying Shame
(Supermassive Black Hole EP)

Too late
Yeah baby it's too late
And time has made the spell obey
And now it's trying to desicrate

But we had a dream
And it was meant to be
And we are kissing gods
Against all the odds

Now it's a crying shame
Well it's a crying shame
You don't know who to blame
Will never be the same
And it's a crying shame

Too much
And we demolished too much
An yeah we really fucked it up
An yeah baby you lost your touch

But we had a dream
And it was meant to be
And we are kissing gods
Against all the odds

Now it's a crying shame
Well it's a crying shame
You don't know who to blame
Will never be the same

And it's a crying shame
Well it's a crying shame

Crying Shame
(Demo Version)

Betrayed,
You bring this to me
And if I cut too much here
You will never smile I swear
Although you cannot see
That it was meant to be
Oh, With your kissing lies
I console the alive

Now It's a crying shame
And It's a crying shame
I need a star to blame
We Will not be ashamed

Into harm
When you crack too far
Never never show the love
That we're bringing, you mustn't try
Although you'll never see
How it is meant to be
With a kissing lie
I console the alive

Now It's a crying shame
And It's a crying shame
We're not to blame
Not like that brutal strain

Do We Need This? 

(Muscle Museum EP)

Too many young and too many old
Too many people left you in the cold
You want everything to change
Cause you are afraid of losing

She only exists when she's on a screen
He's only alive inside a machine
We want everything to change
Cause we are afraid of losing

Tell me do you really need this
Tell me do you really care
Tell me do you really need this
Tell me do you really care
I don't think you really need this
I don't think you really care
I don't think you really need this
I don't think you really care

Too many young and too many old
To many people left in the cold
We want everything to change
Now I'm so afraid of losing
Yeah yeah yeah 

Easily

( Starlight EP )

Let your inhibitions go
Make every touch electrical
When you're feeling beautiful
Will you remember me

I want to touch you deep inside
Find the secrets that you hide
When your fears are cast aside
Will you remember me?

Easily forgotten love
Easily forgotten love
It's not so easily

I just want to let you know
My mind refuses to let you go
I want to hypnotise you so
You will remember me

Easily forgotten love
Easily forgotten love
It's not so easily

Easily forgotten love
Easily forgotten love
Easily the best I ever had
Easily the best I ever had

Emergency

( Live Eurocks 2002 )

Declare this an emergency
Come on and spread a sense of urgency
To pull us through
And pull us through

This is the end
This is the end
Walk away

It's time we saw a miracle
Come on it's time for something biblical
To pull us through
And pull us through

This is the end
This is the end
Walk away

Declare this an emergency
Come on and spread a sense of urgency
To pull us through
And pull us through

This is the end
This is the end
Walk away

*** Thanx a lot to Thomas for this one ***

Eternally Missed

(Hysteria EP)

Chase your dreams away
Glass needles in the hay
The sun forgives the clouds
You are my holy shroud

I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels

No it doesn't change
And you can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
And you can't resist
And you can't resist
Making me feel

Chase your dreams away
Glass needles in the hay
The sun forgives the clouds
You are my holy shroud

And I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels

No it doesn't change
And you can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel

You can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel

You can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
And you can't resist
And you can't resist
Making me feel

Futurism

(Origin of Symmetry Japanese edition / Dead Star EP)

Ignorance pulls
Apostasy and apathy still rules
Yeah you know it's cool
Just suck and see
A future turns us into silent gods
And I won't miss you at all

Grounded
Boxed in
Like the evil in your veins
Grounded
Boxed in
I am stuck with you

Fate can't decide
Alignment of the planets in your hands
Come on and crush our plans
Just wait and see
A future that won't let you disagree
And I won't miss you at all

Grounded
Boxed in
Like the evil in your veins
Grounded
Boxed in
I am stuck with you

Feel it, hear it, apathy
See it, be it, you'll see

*** Thanx a lot to Riccardo & Muse for this one ***

Glorious

( Black Holes And Revelations Bonus Track )

Rose tinted view
And satellites that
Compromise the truth

But I wanted more
With the cuts and the bruises
Touch my face
A hopeless embrace

Faith
It drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a stranger's love

It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies and feeds the curse
Believe we could be glorious

I need to believe
But I still want more
With the cuts and the bruises
Don't close the door
On what you adore

And faith
It drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a stranger's love

It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies and feeds the curse
Believe we could be glorious

*** Thanx a lot to Wendy for this one ***

Host 

(Cave EP)

I've read you well
I just want to get away
Cos you used my love
I just need to get away

My trust in you has been abused
My trust in you has been overused

Sick of this space
Wish we could be far away
Cos I wasted all my youth
I'll never see it again

My trust in you has been abused
My trust in you has been overused

Why can you get everything?
Can you tell me why I just want to run away?
Can you tell me why I just want to get away?

I just want to get away...

I just wanted too much
I wish we could be far away
And if my wish comes true
You'll never see me again

In the house of the Rising Sun

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor boy
And God I know I'm one

Pink Ego Box

(Muscle Museum EP)

It's gonna be ok
I can't afford another day
At 50 bytes per second

I've never seen your face
I've never heard your voice

But I think I like it
When you instant message me
With a promise
I can feel it 
I can tell you're gonna be
Just like me

My eyes are gonna strained
My heart is feeling pain
At 50 beats per second

I've never seen your eyes
I've never heard your lies

But I think I like it
When you instant message me
With a promise
I can feel it
I can tell you're gonna be
Just like me
Just like me

You turn
You turn
You turn on me

Please, Let Me Get What I Want

(The Smiths Cover / Feeling Good EP / 'Not another teen movie' OST)

Good times for a change
See, the luck I've had
Can make a good man turn bad

So please please please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want this time

Haven't had a dream in a long time
See, the life I've had
Can make a good man bad

So for once in my life let me get what I want
Lord knows, it would be the first time
Lord knows, it would be the first time

Spiral static

(Showbiz Japanese Edition / Plug in Baby EP)

Who's ever known 
How much to moan and groan 
And quiver inside 
He needs to give you 
Everything you need 
Is it enough

You're running out of time 
As it grows in your eye 
Feel broken inside you feel

Sigh, static moans 
A storm growing strong 
And it's coming my way 
Still she gives you 
Everything you need 
Is it enough

You're running out of time 
As it grows in your eye 
You'll feel broken inside 
You'll feel 
And I'll feel broken inside you

Feel

The Groove

(Time is running out EP)

So here it gives again
Rape and pillage prooves
To win the public vote
Someone tell me who will take the prize
And who takes the fall

So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove

Down town comes again
And her masks are shifting l
ike a chameleon
Someone tell me why she breaks my fall
And then breaks my heart

So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove

Wow

So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove

*** Thanx a lot to Steve & Emma for this one ***

Twin

(Cave EP)

Your warmth, your warmth
Is so deep
Your gaze
Beams a hole inside me

Controlling again
Unseparated twins
Controlling again

You've sucks
All the breath out of me
You'll squeeze
All the life out of me

Controlling again
Unseparated twins
Controlling again

Controlling again
Unseparated twins
You'd rather be
Come gentle, slowly
Gentle... 

Who Knows Who

(Uprising EP / Featuring Mike Skinner)

Money-men mill about Monday morning
Another new nothing and never nearer
Consumed at the cost that it's currently costing
I don't dare dig any deeper down
I don't have the head-space

I don't understand all the figures and facts
It'll spin around till I start panic attacking
But there's one curve ball that states my soul
Let me live out life and I'll stay control

Take that away, I'll never get dressed
Money-men milling in Monday morning
I will go spend or I will raise warning
I'm nothing but me and mine, so

Yeah, I've been gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't turn it up
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power

Yeah, I've been gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't turn it up
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power

My name's magic and it's mud
I do bad things but I can rob
They don't buy anything, they watch it, see
For their time is the commodity

The gap between art and artist grows
I never know why I ever wrote this prose
I write this rubbish but believe you me
I've just never been keen on tasting redness
But put the orange suit on, shackle my ankles
I couldn't take that, I'd be fucking ???? off

Yeah, I've been gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't turn it up
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power

Yeah, I've been gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't turn it up
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power

I don't promote no violence but
If you all got carted off
Boys will be boys, toys'll get tossed
Bang me up, right and rough
I'm not a people-beater but
If that law gets made up on me
Show me the cross and I'll take it on

I don't promote no violence but
If you all got carted off
Boys'll be boys, toys'll get tossed
Bang me up, right and rough
I'm not a people-beater but
If that law gets made up on me
Show me the cross and I'll take it on

(Now go low, Ha-ha-ha!)

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want

(Stay on the floor!)

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want

Yeah, I've been gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't turn it up
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power

Yeah, I've been gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't turn it up
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power
